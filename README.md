# discounted-chance-constrained-control
discounted chance constraint reformulated using Chebyshev inequality, problem considered in term of control aspect, that is, the feedback gain is fixed.
Hello there, let's say the initial bound of the chance constraint is Epsilon_0,what I am going to do is to calculate a sequence of Epsilon(k),where k ranges from 0 to ..., to ensure the feasibility of the problem.
